    <h2>Let's get acquainted with my dream Motorcycle <span style="color: #00ff84">Kawasaki-Ninja-ZX10R</span></h2>
    <p>The Ninja bloodline makes up Kawasaki’s fiercest two-wheeled warriors, and when the battlefield is set at the racetrack, the Ninja ZX-10R leads the charge for the Japanese firm. With seven World Superbike Championship titles to its name, six of which with Kawasaki Racing Team pilot Jonathan Rea at the helm, the ZX-10R has proven itself time and time again.

        The 2021 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R’s refinement this year goes well beyond its fresh new looks and more track-focused riding position. Indeed, the engineering fairy dust has resulted in a more agile chassis, refined suspension, and engine tweaks to satisfy Euro 5 emissions standards, as well as the needs of KRT and Mr. Rea.</p>
