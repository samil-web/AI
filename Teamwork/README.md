This is a one day group task of using Python + OpenCV2 to detect road lanes for a self-driving car.<br>
Todo:<br>
- [ ] Get some images of roads to work with, we will work exclusively with motorway images
  - Left Side
  - Middle
  - Right Side
- [ ] Isolate the different lane markings 
  - Dashed
  - Solid
- [ ] Get contour info of those markings
- [ ] Use that info to create annotations
  - Midpoints
  - Lane boundaries
