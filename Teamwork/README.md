<p> This is a one day group task of using Python + OpenCV2 to detect road lanes for a self-driving car
<p> Todo:<br>
  - [ ] Get some images of roads to work with, we will work exclusively with motorway images
    - Left Side
    - Middle
    - Right Side
  - [ ] Isolate the different lane markings
    - Dashed
    - Solid
  - [ ] Get contour info of those markings
  - [ ] Use that info to create annotations
    - Midpoints
    - Lane boundaries
