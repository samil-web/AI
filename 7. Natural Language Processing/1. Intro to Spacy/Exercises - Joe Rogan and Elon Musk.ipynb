      "Well the flame we didnt put a lot of time into the flamethrower This was an offthecuff thing Its sort of a hobbycompany called the Boring Company which started out as a joke and we decided to make a real and dig a tunnelunder LA And then other people asked us to dig tunnels And so we said yes in a few cases\n",
      "Now who\n",
      "And then we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time And we started off witha cap And there was only one thing on which is BoringCompanycomhat Thats it And then we sold the hatslimited edition It just said The Boring Company\n",
      "And then Im a big fan of Spaceballs the movie And in Spaceballs Yogurt goes through the merchandisingsection and they have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs And like the kids love that oneThats the line when he pulls up the flamethrower Its like We should do a flamethrower So we\n",
      "Does anybody tell you no Does anybody go Elon maybe for yourself but selling a flamethrower the liabilities allthe people youre selling this device to what kind of unhinged people are going to be buying a flamethrower in thefirst place Do we really want to connect ourselves to all these potential arsonists httpssonixai\n",
      "Yeah its a terrible idea Its terrible Dont buy one I said Dont buy this flamethrower Dont buy it Dont buy itThats what I said but still people bought it\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Theres nothing I can do to stop them I did not stop them\n",
      "You build it they will come\n",
      "I said Dont buy it Its a bad idea\n",
      "How many did you make\n",
      "Its dangerous Its wrong Dont buy it And still people bought it I just couldnt stop them\n",
      "How many did you make\n",
      "20000\n",
      "And theyre all gone\n",
      "In three  I think four days They sold out in four days\n",
      "Are you going to do another run\n",
      "No\n",
      "No thats it\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Oh I see\n",
      "I said were doing 20 We did 50000 50000 hats and that was a million dollars I thought Okay Well well sellsomething for 10 million and that was 20000 flamethrowers at 500 each They went fast\n",
      "Yeah How do you have the time How do you have the time to do that though I mean I understand that its not abig deal in terms of all the other things you do but how do you have time to do anything I just  I dontunderstand your time management skills\n",
      "I mean I didnt spend much time on this flamethrower I mean to be totally frank its actually just a roofing torchwith an air rifle cover Its not a real flamethrower\n",
      "Which is why it says Not a flamethrower\n",
      "Thats why we were very clear this is not actually a flamethrower And also we are told that various countrieswould ban shipping of it that they would ban flamethrowers So were very  To solve this problem for all of thecustoms agencies we labeled it Not a flamethrower\n",
      "Did it work Was it effective\n",
      "I dont know I think so Yes\n",
      "So far\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Now but you do\n",
      "Because they said you cannot ship a flamethrower\n",
      "But you do so many different things Forget about the flamethrower Like how do you do all that other shit Likehow does one decide to fix LA traffic by drilling holes in the ground And who do you even approach with that Likewhen you have this idea who do you talk to about that\n",
      "I mean Im not saying its going to be successful or something you know Its not like asserting that its going to besuccessful But so far Ive lived in LA for 16 years and the traffic has always been terrible And so I dont see anyother like ideas for improving the traffic So in desperation were going to dig a tunnel And maybe that tunnelwill be successful and maybe it wont\n",
      "Im listening\n",
      "Yeah Im not trying to convince you its going to work\n",
      "And are the people that you\n",
      "I mean or anyone\n",
      "But you are starting this though This is actually a project youre starting to implement right\n",
      "Yeah yeah no Weve dug about a mile Its quite long It takes a long time to walk it\n",
      "Yeah Now when youre doing this what is the ultimate plan The ultimate plan is to have these in major citiesand anywhere theres mass congestion and just try it out in LA first\n",
      "Yeah Its in LA because I mostly live in LA Thats the reason Its a terrible place to dig tunnels This is one of theworst places to dig tunnels mostly because of the paperwork You all think its like What about seismic Its likeactually both tunnels are very safe in earthquakes\n",
      "Why is that\n",
      "Earthquakes are essentially a surface phenomenon Its like waves on the ocean So if theres a storm you want tobe in a submarine So being in a tunnel is like being in a submarine Now the way the tunnel is constructed itsconstructed out of these interlocking segments kind of like a snake Its sort of like a snake exoskeleton withdouble seals\n",
      "And so even when the ground moves the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an undergroundsnake and it doesnt crack or break And its extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken And its capable oftaking five atmospheres of pressure Its waterproof methaneproof well gasproof of any kind and meets allCalifornia seismic requirements\n",
      "So when you have this idea who do you bring this to\n",
      "Im not sure what you mean by that\n",
      "Well youre implementing it So youre digging holes in the ground\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Like you have to bring it to someone that lets you do it\n",
      "Yes There are some engineers from SpaceX who thought it would be cool to do this And the guy who runs it likedaytoday is Steve Davis Hes a longtime SpaceX engineer He is great So Steve was like Id like to help makethis happen I was like Cool So we started off with digging a hole in the ground Its got like a permit for a pitlike pit and just dug a big pit\n",
      "And you have to tell them what the pits for or you just said Hey we just want to dig a hole\n",
      "I just filled up this form\n",
      "Thats it\n",
      "Yeah it was a pit in our parking lot\n",
      "But do you have to give them some sort of a blueprint for your ultimate idea And do they have to approve it Likehow does that work\n",
      "Now We just started off with a pit\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "A big pit And you know its not really  You know they dont really care about the existential nature of a pit Youjust say like I want a pit\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Yeah And its a hole in the ground So then we got the permit for the pit and we dug the pit and we dug it in likeI dont know three days two to three days Actually I think two 48 hours something like that because Eric Carrsaid he was coming by for the Hype Hes going to attend the Hyperloop Competition which is like a studentcompetition we have for who can make the fastest part in the Hyperloop And he was coming\n",
      "The finals are going to be on Sunday afternoon And so Eric is coming by on Sunday afternoon Hes like Youknow we should dig this pit and then like show Eric So this was like Friday morning And then yeah So itsabout a little over 48 hours later we dug the pit There was like wind 247 Oh 24 48 straight hours somethinglike that And dug this big pit and were like Show Eric the pit Its like obviously its just a pit But hey a holein the ground is better than no hole in the ground\n",
      "And what did you tell him about this pit I mean you just said this is the beginning of this idea\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Were going to build tunnels under LA to help funnel traffic better\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "And they just go Okay But weve joked around about this in the podcast before to like what if a person can go tothe people that run the city and go Hey I want to dig some holes on the ground and put some tunnels in thereand they go Oh yeah okay\n",
      "Not the only one with a hole in the ground\n",
      "But its a\n",
      "People dig holes in the ground all time\n",
      "But my question is like I know how much time you must be spending on your Tesla factory I know how much timeyou must be spending on SpaceX And yet you still have time to dig holes under the ground in LA and come upwith these ideas and then implement them Like\n",
      "I have a million ideas\n",
      "Im sure you do\n",
      "Theres no shortage of that Yeah\n",
      "I just dont know how you manage your time I dont understand it It doesnt seem  It doesnt even seem humanlypossible\n",
      "You know I do basically  I think people like dont totally understand what I do with my time They think like Ima business guy or something like that Like my Wikipedia page says business magnate\n",
      "What would you call yourself\n",
      "A business magnet Can someone please change my Wikipedia page to magnet\n",
      "Theyll change it for you\n",
      "Please change\n",
      "Right now its probably already changed\n",
      "Its locked So somebody has to be able to unlock it and change it to magnet\n",
      "Someone will get that\n",
      "I want to be a magnet No I do engineering you know and manufacturing and that kind of thing Thats like 80or more of my time\n",
      "Ideas and then the implementation of those ideas\n",
      "Those are like hardcore engineering like\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      " designing things you know\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Its structural mechanical electrical software user interface engineering aerospace engineering\n",
      "But you must understand theres not a whole lot of human beings like you You know that right Youre an oddity\n",
      "Yes\n",
      " to chimps like me\n",
      "Were all chimps\n",
      "Yeah we are\n",
      "Were one notch One notch above a chimp\n",
      "Some of us are a little more confused When I watch you doing all these things Im like How does thismotherfucker have all this time and all this energy and all these ideas and then people just let him do thesethings\n",
      "Because Im an alien\n",
      "Thats what Ive speculated\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Then Im on record saying this in the past I wonder\n",
      "Its true\n",
      "I mean if there was one I was like If there was like maybe an intelligent being that we created you know likesome AI creature thats superior to people maybe its just hanging around with us for a little while like youve beendoing and then fix a bunch of shit I mean thats the way\n",
      "I might have some mutation or something like that\n",
      "You might Do you think you do\n",
      "Probably\n",
      "Do you wonder Like around normal people youre like Hmm Think Whats up with these boring dumbmotherfuckers ever\n",
      "Not bad for a human but I think I will not be able to hold a candle to AI\n",
      "You scared the shit out of me when you talk about AI between you and Sam Harris\n",
      "Oh sure\n",
      "I didnt consider it until I had a podcast with Sam once\n",
      "Thats great\n",
      "And he made me shit my pants Talking about AI I realized like Oh this is a genie that once its out of the bottleyoure never getting it back in\n",
      "Thats true\n",
      "There was a video that you tweeted about one of those Boston dynamic robots\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "And youre like In the future it will be moving so fast you cant see it without a strobe light\n",
      "Yeah You can probably do that right now\n",
      "And no ones really paying attention too much other than people like you or people that are really obsessed withtechnology all these things are happening And these robots are  Do you see the one where PETA put out astatement that you shouldnt kick robots\n",
      "Its probably not wise\n",
      "For retribution\n",
      "Their memory is very good\n",
      "I bet its really good\n",
      "Its really good\n",
      "I bet it is\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "And getting better every day\n",
      "Its really good\n",
      "Are you honestly legitimately concerned about this Are you  Is like AI one of your main worries in regards to thefuture\n",
      "Yes Its less of a worry than it used to be mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude\n",
      "So you used to have more hope and you gave up some of it And now you dont worry as much about AI Yourelike This is just what it is\n",
      "Pretty much Yes yes yes\n",
      "Was that not Yes but no\n",
      "Its not necessarily bad Its just its definitely going to be outside of human control\n",
      "Not necessarily bad right\n",
      "Yes Its not necessarily bad Its just outside of human control Now the thing thats going to be tricky here is thatits going to be very tempting to use AI as a weapon Its going to be very tempting In fact it will be used as aweapon So the on ramp to serious AI the danger is going to be more humans using it against each other I thinkmost likely That will be the danger Yeah\n",
      "How far do you think we are from something that can make its own mind up whether or not somethings ethically ormorally correct or whether or not it wants to do something or whether or not it wants to improve itself or whetheror not it wants to protect itself from people or from other AI How far away are we from something thats reallytruly sentient\n",
      "Well I mean you could argue that any group of people like a company is essentially a cybernetic collective ofpeople and machines Thats what a company is And then there are different levels of complexity in the way thesecompanies are formed And then theres a sort of like a collective AI in the Google sort of Search Google Searchyou know where were all sort of plugged in as like nodes on the network like leaves on a big tree\n",
      "And were all feeding this network with our questions and answers Were all collectively programming the AI AndGoogle Plus all the humans that connect to it are one giant cybernetic collective This is also true of Facebook andTwitter and Instagram and all the social networks Theyre giant cybernetic collectives\n",
      "Humans and electronics all interfacing and constantly now constantly connected\n",
      "Yes constantly\n",
      "One of the things that Ive been thinking about a lot over the last few years is that one of the things that drives alot of people crazy is how many people are obsessed with materialism and getting the latest greatest thing And Iwonder how much of that is  Well a lot of it is most certainly fueling technology and innovation And it almostseems like its built into us Its like what we like and what we want that were fueling this thing thats constantlyaround us all the time\n",
      "And it doesnt seem possible that people are going to pump the brakes It doesnt seem possible at this stagewhere were constantly expecting the newest cellphone the latest Tesla update the newest MacBook ProEverything has to be newer and better And thats going to lead to some incredible point And it seems like its builtinto us It almost seems like its an instinct that were working towards this that we like it Our job just like theants build the anthill our job is to somehow know how fuel this\n",
      "Yes I mean I made this comment some years ago but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for AIEffectively we are building it And then were building progressively greater intelligence And the percentage ofintelligence that is not human is increasing And eventually we will represent a very small percentage ofintelligence But the AI is informed strangely by the human limbic system It is in large part our id writ large\n",
      "How so\n",
      "We mentioned all those things the sort of primal drives Theres all of the things that we like and hate and fearTheyre all there on the internet Theyre a projection of our limbic system Thats true\n",
      "No it makes sense And the thinking of it as a  I mean thinking of corporations and just thinking of just humanbeings communicating online through these social media networks in some sort of an organism thats a  Its acyborg Its a combination Its a combination of electronics and biology\n",
      "Yeah This is  In some measure like its to the success of these online systems Its sort of a function of how muchlimbic resonance theyre able to achieve with people The more limbic resonance the more engagement\n",
      "Whereas like one of the reasons why probably Instagram is more enticing than Twitter\n",
      "Limbic resonance\n",
      "Yeah You get more images more video\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Its tweaking your system more\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Do you worry or wonder in fact of what the next step is I mean a lot of you didnt see Twitter coming You knowcommunicate with 140 characters or 280 now would be a thing that people would be interested in Like its goingto excel Its going to become more connected to us right\n",
      "Yes Things are getting more and more connected Theyre at this point constrained by bandwidth Ourinputoutput is slow particularly output Output got worse with thumbs You know we used to have input with 10fingers Now we have thumbs But images are just also other way of communicating at high bandwidth You takepictures and you send pictures to people What sends that communicates far more information than you cancommunicate with your thumb\n",
      "So what happened with you where you decided or you took on a more fatalistic attitude Like was there anyspecific thing or was it just the inevitability of our future\n",
      "I try to convince people to slow down Slow down AI to regulate AI Thats whats futile I tried for years and nobodylistened\n",
      "This seems like a scene in a movie\n",
      "Nobody listened\n",
      " where the the robots are going to fucking takeover Youre freaking me out Nobody listened\n",
      "Nobody listened\n",
      "No one Are people more inclined to listen today It seems like an issue thats brought up more often over the lastfew years than it was maybe 510 years ago It seemed like science fiction\n",
      "Maybe they will So far they havent I think people dont  Like normally the way that regulations work is veryslow its very slow indeed So usually it will be something some new technology It will cause damage or deathThere will be an outcry There will be an investigation Years will pass There will be some sort of insightscommittee There will be rule making Then there will be oversight absolutely of regulations This all takes manyyears This is the normal course of things\n",
      "If you look at say automotive regulations how long did it take for seatbelts to be implemented to be requiredYou know the auto industry fought seatbelts I think for more than a decade It successfully fought any regulationson seatbelts even though the numbers were extremely obvious If you had seatbelts on you would be far less likelyto die or be seriously injured It was unequivocal And the industry fought this for years successfully Eventuallyafter many many people died regulators insisted on seatbelts This is a  This time frame is not relevant to AI Youcant take 10 years from a point of which its dangerous Its too late\n",
      "And you feel like this is decades away or years away from being too late If you have this fatalistic attitude and youfeel like its going  Were in an almost like a doomsday countdown\n",
      "Its not necessarily a doomsday countdown Its a\n",
      "Out of control countdown\n",
      "Out of control yeah People quote the singularity and thats probably a good way to think about it Its asingularity Its hard to predict like a black hole what happens past the event horizon\n",

      "Once the genie is out of the bottle whats going to happen\n",
      "Right And it will be able to improve itself\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Thats where it gets spooky right The idea that it can do thousands of years of innovation very very quickly\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "And then it will be just ridiculous\n",
      "Ridiculous\n",
      "We will be like this ridiculous biological shitting pissing thing trying to stop the gods No stop Were like livingwith a finite lifespan and watching you know Norman Rockwell paintings\n",
      "It could be terrible and it could be great Its not clear\n",
      "Right\n",
      "But one thing is for sure we will not control it\n",
      "Do you think that its likely that we will merge somehow or another with this sort of technology and itll augmentwhat we are now or do you think it will replace us\n",
      "Well thats the scenario The merge scenario with AI is the one that seems like probably the best Like if\n",
      "For us\n",
      "Yes Like if you cant beat it join it Thats\n",
      "Yes yeah\n",
      "You know So from a longterm existential standpoint thats like the purpose of Neuralink is to create a highbandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbiotic with AI because we have a bandwidth problem Youjust cant communicate through fingers Its too slow\n",
      "And wheres Neuralink at right now\n",
      "I think well have something interesting to announce in a few months Thats at least an order of magnitudebetter than anything else I think better than probably anyone thinks is possible\n",
      "How much can you talk about that right now\n",
      "I dont want to jump the gun on that\n",
      "But whats like the ultimate Whats the idea behind that Like what are you trying to accomplish with it Whatwould you like best case scenario\n",
      "I think best case scenario we effectively merge with AI where AI serves as a tertiary cognition layer where wevegot the limbic system Kind of the you know primitive brain essentially You got the cortex So youre currently in asymbiotic relationship Your cortex and limbic system are in a symbiotic relationship And generally people liketheir cortex and they like their limbic system I havent met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system ordelete their cortex Everybody seems to like both\n",
      "And the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system People may think that the thinking part of themselves is incharge but its mostly their limbic system thats in charge And the cortex is trying to make the limbic systemhappy Thats what most of that computing power is Its launched towards How can I make the limbic systemhappy Thats what its trying to do\n",
      "Now if we do have a third layer which is the AI extension of yourself that is also symbiotic And theres enoughbandwidth between the cortex and the AI extension of yourself such that the AI doesnt de facto separate Thenthat could be a good outcome That could be quite a positive outcome for the future\n",
      "So instead of replacing us it will radically change our capabilities\n",
      "Yes It will enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition anyone who wants This is not a matter ofearning power because your earning power would be vastly greater after you do it So its just like anyone whowants can just do it in theory Thats the theory And if thats the case then and lets say billions of people do itthen the outcome for humanity will be the sum of human will the sum of billions of peoples desire for the future\n",
      "That billions of people with enhanced cognitive ability\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Radically enhanced\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "And which would be  It  But how much different than people today Like if you had to explain it to a person whodidnt really understand what youre saying like how much different are you talking about When you say radicallyimproved like what do you mean You mean mind reading\n",
      "It will be difficult to really appreciate the difference Its kind of like how much smarter are you with a phone orcomputer than without Youre vastly smarter actually You know you can answer any question If you connect tothe internet you can answer any question pretty much instantly any calculation that your phones memory isessentially perfect You can remember flawlessly Your phone can remember videos pictures everything perfectlyThats the\n",
      "Your phone is already an extension of you Youre already a cyborg You dont even  What most people dontrealize they are already a cyborg That phone is an extension of yourself Its just that the data rate the rate atwhich  The communication rate between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself that is your phone andcomputer is slow Its very slow\n",
      "And that is like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self And we need tomake that tiny straw like a giant river A huge high band with the interface Its an interface problem data rateproblem Its all the data rate problem that I think we can hang on to human machine symbiosis through the longterm And then people may decide that they want to retain their biological self or not I think theyll probablychoose to retain the biological self\n",
      "Versus some sort of Ray Kurzweil scenario where they download themselves into a computer\n",
      "You will be essentially snapshotted into a computer at any time If your biological self dies you could probably justupload it to a new unit literally\n",

      "Down the rabbit hole\n",

      "I believe you If I was talking to one  Cheers by the way\n",
      "Cheers It is a great whiskey\n",

      "Its good\n",
      " thanks\n",
      "Its good\n",
      "Yeah it is good This is just inevitable Again going back to when you decided to have this fatalistic viewpoint Soyou werent  You tried to warn people You talked about this pretty extensively Ive read several interviews whereyou talked about this And then you just sort of just said Okay it just is Lets just And in a way bycommunicating the potential for  I mean for sure youre getting the warning out to some people\n",
      "Yeah Yeah I mean I was really going on the warning quite a lot I was warning everyone I could Yeah Ive metwith Obama and just for one reason like Better watch out\n",
      "Just talk about AI\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "And what did he say So what about Hillary Worry about her first Shh everybody quiet\n",
      "He listened He certainly listened I met with Congress I met with  I was at a meeting of all 50 governors andtalked about just the AI danger And I talked to everyone I could No one seemed to realize where this was going\n",
      "Is it that or do they just assume that someone smarter than them is already taking care of it Because whenpeople hear about something like AI its almost abstract Its almost like its so hard to wrap your head around it\n",
      "It is\n",
      "By the time it happens it will be too late\n",
      "Yeah I think they didnt quite understand it or didnt think it was near term or not sure what to do about it And Isaid like you know an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee government committee to gaininsight You know before you oversight before you do make regulations you should like try to understand whatsgoing on And then you have an insight committee Then once they learn whats going on you get up to speedThen they can make maybe some rules or proposed some rules And that would be probably a safer way to goabout things\n",
      "It seems  I mean I know that its probably something that the governments supposed to handle but it seems likeI wouldnt want the  I dont want the government to handle this\n",

      "Right but maybe companies could agree Maybe there could be some sort of a  What I mean is we haveagreements where youre not supposed to dump toxic waste into the ocean youre not supposed to do certainthings that could be terribly damaging even though they would be profitable Maybe this is one of those things\n",

      "Really Interesting\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Probably separate them Yeah\n",
      "I mean how many are there in a cage you know I was like\n",
      "Right\n",
      " Its going to be pretty intense\n",
      "Yeah yeah Yeah were a weird thing you know And Ive often wondered whether or not were  you know ourultimate goal is to give birth to some new thing And thats why were so obsessed with technology because its notlike this technology is really  I mean its certainly enhancing our lives too in a certain way but I meanultimately is it making people happier right now Most technology I would say no In fact you and I were talkingabout social media before this about just not having Instagram on your phone and not dealing and you feel better\n",
      "Yes I think one of the issues with social media its been pointed out by many people is that I think maybeparticularly Instagram people look like they have a much better life than they really do\n",
      "Right\n",
      "So\n",
      "By design\n",
      "Yeah People are posting pictures of when theyre really happy Theyre modifying those pictures to be betterlooking Even if theyre not modifying the pictures theyre at least selecting the pictures for the best lighting thebest angle So people basically seem they are way better looking than they basically really are\n",
      "Right\n",
      "And theyre way happier seeming than they really are So if you look at everyone on Instagram you might thinkMan there are all these happy beautiful people and Im not that good looking and I am not happy So I mustsuck you know And thats going to make you feel sad when in fact those people you think are super happyactually not that happy Some of them are really depressed Theyre very sad Some of the happiestseemingpeople are actually some of the saddest people in reality And nobody looks good all the time It doesnt matter whoyou are\n",
      "No Its not even something you should want\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Why do you want to look great all the time\n",
      "Yeah exactly So I think things like that can make people quite sad just by comparison because youre sort of People generally think of themselves relative to others Its like we are constantly rebaselining our expectationsAnd you can see to say if you watch some show like Naked and Afraid or you know if you just go and try living inthe woods by yourself for a while and youre like The land that civilization is quite great People want to comeback to civilization pretty fast on Naked or Afraid\n",
      "Wasnt there a Theodore quote that Comparison is the thief of joy\n",
      "Yeah Happiness is reality minus expectations\n",
      "Thats great too but the comparison is the thief of joy really holds true to people Is it\n",
      "Theodore Roosevelt\n",
      "Roosevelt fascinating And when youre thinking about Instagram because what essentially Instagram is for a lot ofpeople is youre giving them the opportunity to be their own PR agent and they always go towards the glamorousyou know And when anybody does show you know nofilter they really do do that Oh youre so brave Look atyou no makeup you know which they look good anyway\n",
      "You look great What are you doing Oh my God You dont have makeup on You still look hot as fuck You knowwhat youre doing I know what youre doing too Theyre letting you know And then theyre feeding off thatcomment section Sort of sitting there like its a fresh stream of love Like youre getting right up to the sources asit comes out of the earth and youre sucking that sweet sweet love water\n",
      "A lot of emojies smoggy emojies\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "A lot of emojies\n",
      "My concern is not so much what Instagram is Its that I didnt think that people had the need for this or theexpectation for some sort of technology that allows them to constantly get love and adulation from strangers andcomments and this ability to project this sort of distorted version of who you really are\n",
      "But I worry about where it goes Like whats the next one Whats the next one Like wheres is it Is it going to beaugmented to some sort of a weird augmented or virtual sort of Instagram type situation where youre not going towant to live in this real world youre going to want to interface with this sort of world that youve created throughyour social media page and some next level thing\n",
      "Yeah Go live in the simulation\n",
      "Yeah man\n",
      "In the simulation\n",
      "Some ready player one type shit thats real That seems  we have that HTC vibe here Ive only done it a coupletimes quite honestly because it kind of freaks me out\n",
      "Sure\n",
      "My kids fucking love it man They love it They love playing these weirdo games and walking around that headseton But part of me watching them do it goes Wow I wonder if this is like the precursor Just sort of like if you lookat that phone that Gordon Gekko had on the beach and you compare that\n",
      "Yes the big cell phone\n",
      "Yeah you pair that to like a Galaxy Note 9\n",
      "Sure\n",
      "Like how the fuck did that become that right And I wonder when I see this HTC Vibe Im like What is that thinggoing to be 10 years from now when were making fun of what it is now I mean how ingrained and howconnected and interconnected is this technology going to be in our life\n",
      "It will be at some point indistinguishable from reality\n",
      "We will lose this Well lose this Like you and I are just looking at each other through our eyes\n",
      "Are we\n",
      "I see you You see me I think I hope\n",
      "You think so\n",
      "I think you probably have regular eyes\n",
      "This could be some simulation\n",
      "It could Do you entertain that\n",
      "Well the argument for the simulation I think is quite strong because if you assume any improvements at all overtime any improvement 1 01 just extend the time frame make it a thousand years a million years Theuniverse is 138 billion years old Civilization if you count it if youre very generous civilization is maybe 7000 or8000 years old if you count it from the first writing This is nothing This is nothing\n",
      "So if you assume any rate of improvement at all then games will be indistinguishable from reality or civilizationwill end One of those two things will occur Therefore we are most likely in a simulation\n",
      "Or were on our way to one right\n",
      "Because we exist\n",
      "Well not just because we exist\n",
      "Pretty exactly\n",
      "We could most certainly be on the road We could be on the road to that right it doesnt mean that it has to havealready happened\n",
      "It could be in base reality It could be in base reality\n",
      "We could be here now on our way to the road or on our way to the destination where this can never happen againwhere we are completely ingrained in some sort of an artificial technology or some sort of a symbiotic relationshipwith the internet or the next level of sharing information But right now were not there yet Thats possible tooright Its possible that a simulation is one day going to be inevitable that were going to have something thatsindistinguishable from regular reality but maybe were not there yet Thats also possible\n",
      "Yes it is\n",
      "Though were not quite there yet This is real You want to touch that wood\n",
      "It feel very real\n",
      "Maybe thats why everybody is like into like mason jars and shit\n",
      "Mason jars\n",
      "Suede shoes People that like craft restaurants and they want raw wood Everyone wants the metal people Itseems like people are like longing toward some weird log cabin type nostalgia\n",
      "Sure reality\n",
      "Yeah like holding on Like clinging\n",
      "Sure\n",
      "Dragging their nails through the man like Dont take me yet\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "I want to\n",
      "But then people go get a mason jar with a wine stem or a handle Thats dark\n",
      "It makes me\n",
      "It makes me lose faith in humanity\n",
      "Mason jar wine stem and a handle they have those\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "The sturdy people Thats just assholes Thats like people make pet rocks\n",
      "Rough\n",
      "Right Some people are just assholes They take advantage of our generous nature\n",
      "It was made with the wine stem Made with handle\n",
      "They made it that way\n",
      "Yes Theyre manufactured like that\n",
      "So the one way they welded it on to the mason jar You fuck\n",
      "But that would be fine if there was like glued it on or something\n",
      "Right There would be like\n",
      "But it was made that way\n",
      "Like trash shit Oh this is disgusting Look at this It is right there\n",
      "Yes its pretty harsh Yup\n",
      "This is terrible Yeah Thats like fake breasts that are designed to be hard Like fake breasts from the 60s Its likeif you really long for the ones with ripples here we go Yeah Thats almost what that is\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "What are you going to do man Theres nothing you know Theres nothing you can do to stop certain terribleideas from propagating\n",
      "Yeah Anyway I dont want to sound like things are too dark because I think like you kind of have to be optimisticabout the future Theres no point in being pessimistic Its just too negative because it is\n",
      "It doesnt help\n",
      "It doesnt help you know I think you want to be  I mean my theory is like youd rather be optimistic I think Idrather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right\n",
      "Right\n",
      "At least were on that side\n",
      "Right yeah\n",
      "Because if youre pessimistic its going to be miserable\n",
      "Yeah Yeah nobody wants to be around you anyway if its the end of the world Youre like I fucking told you bro\n",
      "Yeah exactly\n",
      "The world is ending Yeah It is way  it is for all\n",
      "I did my part\n",
      "I mean\n",
      "Enjoy the journey\n",
      "Right If you really want to get morose I mean it is what it is for all of us anyway Were all going to go unlesssomething changes\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I mean ultimately you know even if we just sort of existed as humans forever wed still eventually would be likethe heat death of the universe\n",
      "Gazillion years from now\n",
      "Right even if we get it past the sun\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "If we figure out a way past the sun running out of juice\n",
      "Eventually its going to end Its just a question of when\n",
      "Right\n",
      "So it really is all about the journey\n",
      "Or transcendence from whatever we are now into something that doesnt worry about death\n",
      "The universe as we know it will dissipate into a fine mist of cold nothingness eventually\n",
      "And then someones going to bottle it and put a fragrance to it sell it to French people in another dimension\n",
      "Its just a very long time\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "So I think its really just about how can we make it last longer\n",
      "Are you a proponent of the multiuniverses theory Do you believe that there are many many universes and thateven if this one fades out that theres other ones that are starting fresh right now and theres an infinite number ofthem and theyre just constantly in a neverending cycle of birth and death\n",
      "I think most likely This is just about probability There are many many simulations These simulations we might aswell call them reality or we could call them the multiverse\n",
      "These simulations you believe are created like someone has manufactured\n",
      "Theyre running on the substrate\n",
      "So\n",
      "That substrate is probably boring\n",
      "Boring\n",
      "Mmhmm\n",
      "How so\n",
      "Well when we create a simulation like a game or a movie its the distillation of whats interesting about life Youknow it takes a year to shoot an action movie And then thats all to slow down into two or three hours So let metell you if youve seen an action movie being filmed its freaking  Its boring Its super boring It takes  Thereslike lots of takes Everythings in a green screen It looks pretty goofy It doesnt look cool But once you had theCGI and have great editing its amazing\n",
      "So I think most likely if were a simulation its really boring outside the simulation because why would you makesimulation as boring Youd make simulation way more interesting than base reality\n",
      "That is if this right now is a simulation\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "And ultimately inevitably as long as we dont die or get hit by a meteor were going to create some sort ofsimulation if we continue on the same technological path were on right now\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "But we might not be there yet So it might not be a simulation here But it most likely is you feel other places\n",
      "This notion of a place or where is\n",
      "Flawed\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Flawed perception\n",

      "Yes\n",

      "Jesus\n",
      "Yeah but as long as the air pump is working at a distance I mean they have backup pumps sort of like you knowthree pumps or four pumps or something And then theres like  It exhausts through the outflow valve andthrough whatever seals are not sealing quite right Usually the door doesnt seal quite right on the plane Sotheres a bit of leakage around the door But the pumps exceed the outflow rate And then that sets the pressure inthe cabin\n",

      "I have a design for a plane\n",
      "You do\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "A better design\n",
      "I mean probably I think it is yes\n",
      "Who have you talked to about this\n",
      "Ive talked to friends\n",
      "Friends\n",
      "Friends and\n",
      "Im your friend\n",
      "Girlfriends and\n",
      "You can tell me What you got Whats going on\n",
      "Well I mean the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeoff and landing supersonic jet ofsome kind\n",
      "Vertical takeoff and landing meaning no need for a runway Just shoot up straight in the air\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "How would you do that I mean they do that in some military aircraft correct\n",
      "Yes The trick is that you have to transition to level flight And then the thing that you would use for vertical takeoffand landing is not suitable for highspeed flight\n",
      "So you have two different systems Vertical takeoff is one system\n",
      "Ive thought about this quite a lot Ive thought about this quite a lot\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "I guess thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible but you need a certain energydensity in the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy Once youve overcomegravitational potential energy and youre out at a high altitude the energy use in cruise is very low And then youcan recapture a large part of the gravitational potential energy on the way down So you really dont need any kindof reserve fuel if you will because you have the energy of height gravitational potential energy This is a lot ofenergy\n",
      "So once you can get high like the way to think about a plane is its a force balance So the force balance  So aplane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance You have the force of gravity you have the lift force youhave the wings Then youve got the force of the whatever thrusting device so the propeller or turbine orwhatever it is And youve got the resistance force of the air\n",
      "Now the higher you go the lower the air resistance is Air density drops exponentially but drag increases with thesquare and exponential beats the square The higher you go the faster you will go for the same amount of energyAnd at a certain altitude you can go supersonic with less energy per mile quite a lot less energy per mile than anaircraft at 35000 feet because its just a force balance\n",
      "Im too stupid for this conversation\n",
      "It makes sense though\n",
      "No Im sure it does Now when you think about this new idea of of design when you have this idea aboutimproving planes are you going to bring this to somebody and check this one out\n",
      "Well I have a lot on my plate\n",
      "Right Thats what Im saying I dont know how you do what you do now but if you keep coming up with these Butits got to be hard to pawn this off on someone else either like Hey go do a good job with this vertical takeoff andlanding system that I want to implement to regular planes\n",
      "The airplane electric airplane isnt necessarily right now Electric cars are important We need\n",
      "We need some sort of\n",
      "Solar energy is important Stationary storage of energy is important These things are much more important thancreating electric supersonic futile Also the planes naturally  You really want that gravitational energy density foran aircraft and this improving over time So you know its important that we accelerate the transition tosustainable energy Thats why electric cars it matters whether electric cars happen sooner or later You knowwere really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere or the oceans\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Were taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this in the atmosphere Its just crazy Weshould not do this Its very dangerous So we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy I mean thebizarre thing is that obviously were going to run out of oil in the long term You know were going to  Theresonly so much oil we can mine and burn Its totally logical We must have a sustainable energy transport andenergy infrastructure in the long term\n",
      "So we know thats the endpoint We know that So why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons ofcarbon from underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans This is an insane experiment Its the dumbestexperiment in human history Why are we doing this Its crazy\n",
      "Do you think this is a product of momentum that we started off doing this when it was just a few engines a fewhundred million gallons of fuel over the whole world not that big of a deal And then slowly but surely over acentury it got out of control And now its not just our fuel but its also I mean fossil fuels are involved in so manydifferent electronics so many different items that people buy Its just this constant desire for fossil fuels constantneed for oil\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Without consideration of the sustainability\n",
      "You know the things like oil oil coal gas its easy money\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Its easy money So\n",
      "Have you heard about clean coal The presidents been tweeting about it Its got to be real CLEAN COAL all capsDid you see He used all caps Clean coal\n",
      "Well you know its very difficult to put that CO2 back in the ground It doesnt like being in solid form\n",
      "Have you thought about something like that\n",
      "It takes a lot of energy\n",
      "Like some sort of a filter giant buildingsized filter sucks carbon out in the atmosphere Is that possible\n",
      "No no it doesnt Its not possible\n",
      "No\n",
      "No\n",
      "No\n",
      "Nope definitely not\n",
      "So were fucked\n",
      "No were not fucked I mean this is quite a complex question\n",
      "Right\n",
      "You know were really just  When we  The more carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphereand a lot of it gets permeated into the oceans the more dangerous it is Like I dont think right  I think were okayright now We can probably even add some more but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow\n",
      "Like theres a vast base of industry vast transportation system Like theres Two and a half billion cars and trucksin the world And the new car and truck production if it was a 100 electric thats only about 100 million per yearSo it would take  If you could snap your fingers and instantly turn all cars and trucks electric it would still take 25years to change the transport base to electric It makes sense because how long does a car and truck last before itgoes into the junkyard and gets crushed About 20 to 25 years\n",
      "Is there a way to accelerate that process like some sort of subsidies or some encouragement from the governmentfinancially\n",
      "Well the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oilburning device Any powerplant or car is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere or just the atmospherefor short So like you can say okay theres a certain probability of something bad happening past a certaincarbon concentration in the atmosphere\n",
      "And so theres some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere things overheatoceans warm up ice caps melt ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable you know if somethingsunderwater but its not clear what that number is But definitely scientists its really quite  The scientificconsensus is overwhelming Overwhelming\n",
      "I mean I dont know any serious scientist actually zero literally zero who dont think you know that we have quitea serious climate risk that were facing And so thats fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuelburning thing power plants aircraft car frankly even rockets I mean rockets use up  you know they burn Theyburn fuel But theres just  you know with rockets theres just no other way to get to orbit unfortunately So itsthe only way\n",
      "But with cars theres definitely a better way with electric cars And to generate the energy do so withphotovoltaics because weve got a giant nuclear reactor in the sky called the sun Its great It sort of shows upevery day very reliable So if you can generate energy from solar panels store up with batteries you can haveenergy 24 hours a day\n",
      "And then you know you can send to the polls or in the air to the north with you know high voltage lines Most ofthe northern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well But anyway all fossil fuelpowered thingshave an inherent subsidy which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans\n",
      "So people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy but theyre not taking into account that allfossil fuelburning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost the environmental cost to earth but nobodyspaying for it We are going to pay for it obviously In the future well pay for it Its just not paid for now\n",
      "And what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars and trucks and things like that Is it battery capacity\n",
      "Yeah You got to scale up production You got to make the car compelling make it better than gasoline or dieselcars\n",
      "Make it more efficient in terms of like the distance it can travel Youre going to be fueling\n",
      "Yeah youre going to be able to go far enough recharge fast\n",
      "And your Roadster youre anticipating 600 miles Is that correct\n",
      "Yeah yeah\n",
      "What is it What is that\n",
      "Yeah 600 miles\n",
      "Is that right now Like have you driven one 600 miles now\n",
      "No We could totally make one right now that would do 600 miles but the thing is too expensive So like the carsgot to\n",
      "How much more so\n",
      "Well you know just have a chartered kilowatt hour battery pack and you can go 600 miles as long as youre\n",
      "Right versus what do you have now\n",
      "330mile range Thats plenty for most people\n",
      "330mile range And what is that mean in terms of kilowatts\n",
      "Well that would be for Model S 100kilowatt hour pack will do about 330 miles Maybe 335 because some peoplehave hyper mild it to 500 miles per mile\n",
      "Hyper mild it What does that mean\n",
      "Yeah just like go on\n",
      "45 miles an hour or something\n",
      "Yeah like 30 miles an hour or so Its like on level ground with  You pump the tires up really well and go on asmooth surface and you can go for a long time But you know like definitely comfortably do 300 miles\n",
      "Is there any\n",
      "This is fine for most people Usually 200 or 250 miles is fine 300 miles is  You dont even think about it really\n",
      "Is there any possibility that you could use solar power solarpowered one day especially in Los Angeles I meanas you said about that giant nuclear reactor a million times bigger than Earth just floating in the sky Is it possiblethat one day youll be able to just power all these cars just on solar power I mean we dont ever have cloudydays if we do just three of them\n",
      "Well the surface area of a car is without making the car look really blocky or having some\n",
      "Like a G wagon\n",
      "Yeah and just like if it looked a lot of surface area or like maybe like solar panels fold out or something\n",
      "Like your E class Thats what it needed\n",
      "That E type\n",
      "Yeah the Jaguar E type with a giant long hood that could be a giant solar panel\n",
      "Well at the beginning of Tesla I did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing Theyd press a button and itwould just like unfold these solar panels and like chargerecharge your car in the parking lot Yeah we could dothat but I think its probably better to just put that on your roof\n",
      "Right yeah\n",
      "And then its going to  It should be facing the sun all the time because like\n",
      "What car have that on the roof\n",
      "Otherwise your car could be in the shade You know it could be in the shade it could be in a garage or somethinglike that\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Didnt the Fisker have that on the roof The Fisker Karma New Generation for  I believe it was only for the radioIs that correct\n",
      "Yeah I mean but I think it could like recharge like two miles a day or something\n",
      "Did you laugh when they started blowing up when they get hit with water Do you remember what happened\n",
      "They got what\n",
      "Yeah they had a dealership or\n",
      "Oh yeah\n",
      "The Fisker Karmas were parked\n",
      "Is that like that with a flood in Jersey\n",
      "Yes yes\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "When the hurricane came in they got overwhelmed with water and they all started exploding Theres a fuckinggreat video of it Did you watch the video\n",
      "I didnt watch the video but I did see  Its like some picture of the aftermath\n",
      "If I was you Id be naked lubed up watch that video laugh my ass off They all blow up They got wet and theyblew up Thats not good\n",
      "Yeah we made our battery waterproof so that doesnt happen Actually\n",
      "Smart move\n",
      "Yeah there was a guy in Kazakhstan that  I think it was Kazakhstan that he just boated through a tunnel anunderwater tunnel like a flooded tunnel and just turned the wheels to steer and pressed the accelerator and itjust floated through the tunnel\n",
      "Wow\n",
      "And he steered around the other cars I mean like\n",
      "Thats amazing\n",
      "Its on the internet\n",
      "What happens if your car gets a little sideways like if youre driving in snow Like what if youre driving if youreautopilot is on and youre in like Denver and it snows out and your car gets a little sideways does it correct itselfDoes that\n",
      "Oh yeah Its got great traction control\n",
      "But does it know how to like correct You know how like when your Ascend\n",
      "Oh yeah sure\n",
      " kicks you know how to counter steer\n",
      "Oh yeah No its really good\n",
      "It knows how to do it\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Whoa\n",
      "Its pretty crazy\n",
      "Thats pretty crazy\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "So like if youre going sideways it knows how to correct itself\n",
      "It generally wont go sideways\n",
      "It wont\n",
      "No\n",
      "Why not\n",
      "It will correct itself before it goes sideways\n",
      "Even in black eyes\n",
      "Yeah Theres videos where you could see the car the traction\n",
      "Not alone\n",
      "Traction control system is very good It makes you feel like Superman Its great You like feel like you can  Likeits  It will make you feel like this incredible driver\n",
      "I believe it\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Now how do you program that\n",
      "We do have testing on like an ice lake in Sweden\n",
      "Oh really\n",
      "Yeah And like Norway and Canada and a few other places\n",
      "Porsche does a lot of that too They do\n",
      "They did it as well\n",
      "They do a lot of their  They do some of their driver training school on these frozen surfaces So youre just  Thecar is going sideways whether you like it or not And you have to learn how to slide into corners and how do wetest\n",
      "Yeah Electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time is so fast\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Sort of like where youre gassing a car youve got a lot of latency It takes a while for the engine to react but forelectric motors incredibly precise Thats why youre like  You imagine like if you had like a printer or somethingyou wouldnt have a gasoline engine printer That would be pretty weird or like a surgical device Its going to be anelectric motor on the surgical device on the printer Gasoline engines going to be just chugging away Its not goingto have the reaction time\n",
      "But to an electric motor its operating at the most second level So it can turn on and off traction within likeinches of getting on the onus Like lets say youre driving on a patch of ice it will turn traction off and then turn iton a couple inches right after the ice like a little patch of ice because in the frame of the electric motor youremoving incredibly slowly Youre like a  Youre a snail Youre just moving so slowly because it can see at athousand frames a second And so its like say one Mississippi It just thought about it things a thousand times\n",
      "So its to realize that your wheels are not getting traction It understands theres some slippery surface that youredriving on\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "And it makes adjustments in real time\n",
      "Yes in milliseconds\n",
      "That would be so much safer than a regular car\n",
      "Yes it is\n",
      "Just that alone for loved ones youd want them to be driving your car\n",
      "Yes The\n",
      "Or on board Fuck motors Dude fuck regular motors\n",
      "That S X and 3 have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government\n",
      "Whoa\n",
      "So this  Yeah but its pretty fun Its pretty crazy Like we  You know people still sue us like theyll have likesome accident at 60 miles an hour where theyd like twisted an ankle and they slipped Like they will be dead inanother car they still sue us\n",
      "But thats to be expected isnt it\n",
      "It is to be expected\n",
      "Do you take that into account with like the same sort of fatalistic you know undertones to sort of just go Youvegot to just let it go This is what people do\n",
      "I tell you Ive got\n",
      "This is what it is\n",
      " Quite a lot of respect for the justice system Judges are very smart And they see  theyve  as like I havent Sofar Ive found judges to be very good at justice because like what  and juries are good too Like theyre actuallyquite good You know people  You know you read about like occasional errors in the justice system Let me tellyou most the time theyre very good\n",
      "And like the other guy mentioned who fell asleep in the car and he rode over a cyclist And that was whatencouraged me to get autopilot out as soon as possible That guy sued us\n",
      "He sued you for falling asleep\n",
      "Yes Im not kidding He blamed it on the new car smell\n",
      "What\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "He blamed him falling asleep on your new car smell Does someone thats a lawyer\n",
      "This is a real thing that happened\n",
      "Someone thats a lawyer that thought that through in front of his laptop before he wrote that up\n",
      "Yes he got a lawyer and he sued us and the judge was like This is crazy Stop bothering me No\n",
      "Thank God\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Thank God Thank God theres a judge out there with a brain\n",
      "I tell you judges are very good\n",
      "Some of them\n",
      "I have a lot of\n",
      "What about that judge that sent all these boys up the river in Pennsylvania who was selling those kids out Youknow about that story\n",
      "Nope\n",
      "Judge was selling young boys to prisons He was like literally\n",
      "What\n",
      "Yeah literally under bribes for  He was\n",
      "Was this an elected judge or\n",
      "He was\n",
      "Because sometimes you have a judge thats like actually a politician\n",
      "No he was a elected judge This is a very famous story\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Hes in jail right now I think for the rest of his life And he put away  He would take like a young boy who woulddo something like steal something from a store and he would put them in detention for you know five yearsSomething ridiculous egregious And they investigated his history And they found out that he was literally beingpaid off Was it by private prisons Is that what the the deal was There was some sort of  But anyway this judgeis\n",
      "Actually two judges\n",
      "Two judges\n",
      "Two judges Kids for cash scandals lets call them\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "2008 yeah Common pleas judges So I think they are elected\n",
      "And who was paying them Someone  It proven to the point where theyre in jail now that someone was payingthem to put more asses in the seats in these private prisons\n",
      "Its like a milliondollar payment to put them in a youth center builder\n",
      "A milliondollar payment\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I do think these private prisons thing is\n",
      "Someone business\n",
      " creating a bad incentive\n",
      "Its dark\n",
      "Right yes But I mean that judge is in prison\n",
      "Thank God\n",
      "Yes but for people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of judges like that I want to assure you\n",
      "No\n",
      " this is not the case The vast majority of judges are very good\n",
      "I agree\n",
      "And they care about justice and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer Andinstead they cared about justice and they made less money because they care about justice And thats whytheyre judges\n",
      "I feel that same way about police officers\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "I feel like theres so many interactions with so many different people with police officers that the very few thatstand out that are horrific we tend to look at that like This is evidence that police are all corrupt And I thinkthats crazy\n",
      "No Most police are very honest\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "And like the military\n",
      "Like they have an insanely\n",
      " personnel that I know\n",
      "Yes\n",
      " are very honorable ethical people\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "And much more honorable and ethical than the average person Thats my impression\n",
      "I agree Thats my impression as well\n",
      "And thats not to suggest that we be complacent and assume everyone is honest and ethical And obviously ifsomebody is given a trusted place in society such as being a police officer or a judge and they are corrupt thenwe must be extra vigilant against such situations\n",
      "Yes\n",
      " and take action But we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession\n",
      "I couldnt agree more I think theres also an issue with one of the things that happens with police officersprosecutors and anyone thats trying to convict someone or arrest someone is that it becomes a game And ingames people want to win\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "And sometimes people cheat\n",
      "Yes yes I mean you know if youre a prosecutor you should not always want to win There are times when youshould like Okay I just should not want to win this case And then you know like just pass on that caseSometimes people want to win too much That is true\n",
      "I think also it becomes tough If youre like a district attorney you know you tend to sort of see a lot of criminalsAnd then your view of the world can get negatively\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "You know have a negative  You know you can have a negative view of the world because you know youre justinteracting with a lot of criminals But actually most of society is not to consist of criminals\n",
      "Right\n",
      "And I actually had this conversation at dinner several years ago with I guess its Tony I was like Man it mustsometimes seem pretty pretty dark because you know man theres some terrible human beings out there Andhe was like Yup And he was like dealing with some case which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would runpeople over somehow for insurance money It was rough Like Wow thats pretty rough Its like hard to maintainfaith in humanity if youre a district attorney but you know its only a few percent of society that are actually bad\n",
      "And then if you go to the worst say 01 of society are the worst one in a thousand one in a million you knowLike how bad is the millionth worst person in the United States Pretty damn bad Like damn evil\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Like the millionth well one in a million of evil is so evil people cannot even conceive of it But theres 330 millionpeople in the United States So thats 330 people out there somewhere But by the same token theres also 330people who are incredible angels and unbelievably good human beings\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "On the other side\n",
      "But because of our fear of danger we tend to  our thoughts tend to gravitate towards the worstcase scenario\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "And we want to frame that And thats one of the real problems with prejudice whether its prejudice towardsdifferent minorities or prejudice towards police officers or anything its like we want to look at the worstcasescenario and say This is an example of what this is all about\n",
      "And you see that even with people how they frame genders Some men frame women like that They get ripped offby a few women and they said All women are evil Some women get fucked over by a few men All men areshit And this is very toxic\n",
      "It is\n",
      "And its also  Its a very unbalanced way of viewing the world and its very emotionallybased and its based onyour own experience your own anecdotal experience And it can be very influential to the people around you andits just its a dangerous way Its a dangerous thought process and pattern to promote\n",
      "It is It is a very dangerous but I really think you know people should give other people the benefit of the doubtand assume that they are good until proven otherwise And I think really most people are actually pretty goodpeople Nobodys perfect\n",
      "They have to be\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "If you think of vast numbers of us that are just interacting with each other constantly\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      " we have to be better than we think we are\n",
      "Yes I mean like\n",
      "Theres no other way\n",
      "I mean here are these weapons but how many times like nobodys presumably try to murder you and youre\n",
      "Nobody yet\n",
      "Yes nobody Its like the sword right there\n",
      "Not the flamethrower fake flamethrower here\n",
      "Exactly\n",
      "Its not a flamethrower Now weve got a real problem Im going to put it on that side to him and leave it for theguests\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Im like Look man if I say something that fucked up its right there\n",
      "It will liven things up for sure Its guaranteed to make any party better\n",
      "Yeah Well thats  I mean thats the armed civilization theory right An armed community is safe and politecommunity\n",
      "You know in Texas its kind of true Yeah I mean\n",
      "People in Texas are super polite Therefore theyve got a gun\n",
      "Yes Dont make somebody angry\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "We dont know whats going to happen\n",
      "Yeah its a good move\n",
      "Yeah\n",

      "Yeah\n",
      "Youre off to just let that guy get in your lane\n",
      "Yeah yeah You know we got a big test site in Central Texas near Waco\n",
      "Oh yeah Beautiful\n",
      "Yes Space X in McGregor Its about 15 minutes away from Waco\n",
      "Thats close to where Ted Nugent lives\n",

      " thats very enticing because of that It is dangerous but its also free\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Yeah I kind of like Texas actually\n",
      "I prefer it over places that are more restrictive but more liberal because you could always be liberal Like justbecause things are free and just because you have a certain amount of you know right wing type characters itdoesnt mean you have to be that way you know\n",
      "No\n",
      "And honestly theres a lot of those people that are pretty fucking open minded and let you do whatever you wantto do\n",
      "Right\n",
      "As long as you dont bother them\n",
      "Yeah exactly\n",
      "Thats my hope right now with the way were able to communicate with each other today and how radicallydifferent it is than generations past because we all  Just the dust settles We all realize like what youre sayingthat most people are good\n",

      "The vast majority\n",

      "Sure Thank you\n",
      "What do you see in terms of like bottlenecks of things that are holding back innovation Is it regulatorycommissions and people that dont understand the technology that are influencing policy Like what couldpotentially be holding you guys back right now Is there anything that you would change\n",
      "Yeah thats a good question You know I wish politicians were better at science That would help a lot\n",
      "Thats a problem\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Theres no incentive for them to be good at science\n",
      "There isnt Actually you know theyre pretty good at science in China I have to say\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Yeah The mayor of Beijing has I believe an environmental engineering degree and the deputy mayor has aphysics degree I met them And Mayor says Shanghai is really smart and\n",
      "Youre up on technology What do you think about this government policy of stopping use of Huawei phones Andtheres something about the the worry about spying I mean from what I understand from real tech people theythink its horseshit\n",
      "Oh I\n",
      "Like phones\n",
      "I dont know I dont know\n",
      "Like the government say Dont you buy Huawei phones Are you up on that at all No Should we just abandonthis idea\n",
      "Well I think like I guess if you have like top secret stuff then you want to be pretty careful about what hardwareyou use But you know like most people do not have top secret stuff\n",
      "Right\n",

      "Yeah\n",

      "Well thats the argument against the narrative And the argument by a lot of these tech people is that the realconcern is that these companies like Huawei are innovating at a radical pace and theyre trying to stop themfrom integrating into our culture and letting this Like right now theyre the number two cell phone manufacturer inthe world\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Samsung is number one Huawei is number two Apple is now number three They surpassed Apple as number twoAnd the idea is that this is all taking place without them having any foothold whatsoever in America Theres nocarriers that have their phones You have to buy their phones unlocked through some sort of a third party and thenput\n",
      "Okay\n",

      "Not really\n",
      "No\n",

      "Is there a time where you think that there will be no security it will be impossible to hold back information thatwhatever bottleneck well let go were going to give in That whatever bottleneck between privacy and ultimateinnovation will have to be bridged in order for us to achieve the next level of technological proficiency that werejust going to abandon it and therell be no security no privacy\n",
      "Do people want privacy Because they seem to put everything on the internet Practically\n",
      "Well right now they are confused but when youre talking about your Neuralink and this this idea that one daywere going to be able to share information and were going to be some sort of a thing thats symbioticallyconnected\n",

      "And when\n",
      "For sure Thats like security will be paramount\n",
      "Sure\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "But also what we will be This will be so much different Our concerns about money about status about where allof these things will seemingly go by the wayside if we really become enlightened if we really become artificiallyenlightened by some sort of an AI interface where we have this symbiotic relationship with some new internet typeconnection to information But you know what happens then What is important What is not important Isprivacy important when were all gods\n",
      "I mean I think the things that we think are important to keep private right now\n",
      "Right\n",

      "Right\n",
      "That other people would actually care about When you think other people care about it but they dont really careabout it And certainly governments dont\n",
      "Well some people care about it But then it gets weird when it gets exposed Like Jennifer Lawrence when thosenaked pictures got exposed like I think in some ways people liked her more\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "They realized like shes just a person Its just a girl who likes sex and is just alive and has a boyfriend and sendshim messages And now you get to look into it and you probably shouldnt have but somebody let it go and theyput it online and all right\n",

      "No\n",

      "What keeps you up at night\n",
      "Well its quite hard to run companies\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Especially car companies I would say Its quite challenging\n",
      "The car business is the hardest one of all the things you do\n",
      "Yes because its a consumeroriented business as opposed to like SpaceX and\n",
      "Not that SpaceX because SpaceX is no walk in the park but a car company its very difficult to keep a carcompany alive Its very difficult You know theres only two companies in the history of American car companiesthat havent gone bankrupt and thats Ford and Tesla Thats it\n",
      "Yeah Ford rode out that crazy storm huh Theyre the only one\n",
      "By the skin of their teeth\n",
      "Shot out to the Mustang\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Yeah by the skin of their teeth That is interesting right\n",
      "Same with Tesla we barely survived\n",
      "How close did you get to folding\n",
      "Very close I mean 2008 is not a good time to be a car company especially a startup car company and especiallyan electric car company That was like stupidity squared\n",
      "And this is when you had those cool Roadsters with the Ttop\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "With a target top\n",
      "Yeah We had like a  It was highly modified Elise chassis The body was completely different By the way that wasa super dumb strategy that we actually did because we\n",
      "Whats dumb\n",
      "It was based on two false premises One false premise was that we would be able to cheaply convert the LotusElise and use that as a car platform and that well be able to use technology from this little company called ACPropulsion for the electric drive train on the battery Premise the AC propulsion technology did not work inproduction and we ended up using none of it in longterm None of it We had to resign everything\n",
      "And then once you add a battery pack and electric motor to the car it got heavier It got 30 heavier It invalidatedthe entire structure all the crash structure Everything had to be redone Nothing Like I think it had less than 7of the parts were common with any other device including cars or anything\n",
      "7\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Everything Including tires and wheels bolts brakes\n",
      "Yeah even every\n",
      "Steering wheel Seat\n",
      "The steering wheel was  I think the steering wheel was almost the same Yes the windscreen The windscreen\n",
      "Different\n",
      "No I think the windscreen is the same\n",
      "Same\n",
      "Yes I think we were able to keep the windscreen\n",
      "But the last was 7 So thats basically\n",
      "Every body panel is different The entire structure was different We couldnt use the like the HVAC system the airconditioner It was beltdriven air conditioner So now we needed something that was electrically driven We needa new AC compressor\n",
      "And all that takes away from the battery life as well right\n",
      "Yeah We need a small highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car and was electrically powerednot beltdriven It was very difficult\n",
      "How much of those weigh those cars the Roadster\n",
      "I think it was 2700 pounds\n",
      "Thats still very light\n",
      "27 Depending on which version 2650 to 2750 pounds something like that\n",
      "And what was the weight distribution\n",
      "It was about 50  Well there were different versions of the car So its about 55 on the rear\n",
      "Thats not bad\n",
      "It was rear bias\n",
      "Right but not bad Considering like a 911 which is like one of the most popular sports cars of all time Heavy rearend bias\n",
      "Well I mean yeah The 911 Im not going to joke is like the master despite Newton not being on their side\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I guess fighting Newton its very difficult\n",
      "Well\n",
      "Its like youve got those  The moments of inertia on a 911 dont make any sense\n",
      "They do once you understand them Once you understand\n",
      "You dont want to hang the engine off the ass This is not a wise move\n",
      "You dont want to let up on the gas when youre in a corner\n",
      "The problem with something where the engine is mounted over the rear axle or off the rear axle towards the rear isthat your polar moment of inertia is fundamentally screwed You cannot solve this Its unsolvable Youre screwedPolar moment of inertia youre screwed\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Like essentially if you spawn the car like a top thats your polar moment of inertia Youre just  I promise Iwouldnt swear on this show by the way\n",
      "Really\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Says who\n",
      "This was for a friend\n",
      "Tell that friend to go fuck himself Who told you not to swear\n",
      "A friend\n",
      "Hes not a good friend\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "That friend need to\n",
      "I said I wouldnt swear\n",
      " realize youre fucking Elon Musk You can do whatever you want man If you ever get confused call me\n",
      "Ill swear in private Swear up a storm\n",
      "Okay just say freaking Its a fun way Its like old house moms Wives and shit that have children Oh thisfreaking thing\n",
      "Yeah But anyway like the Portia its kind of incredible how well Porsche handles given that its the physics\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "The moments of inertia are so messed up To actually still make it work well is incredible\n",
      "Well if you know how to turn into the corner once you get used to the feeling of it theres actual benefits to it Youknow there are some benefits\n",
      "I enjoy The car I had before Tesla was a 911\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "That was\n",
      "997 or 6\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "997\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Yeah Great car man\n",
      "Yeah I mean particularly the Porsche wouldnt have the variable veins on the turbo and it didnt have the turbolag That was great\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "That was really great The turbo lag is like you know if you flirt like phone home call your mom\n",
      "The older one right\n",
      "Its like about an hour later\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      " the car accelerates\n",
      "And super dangerous too because where it will start spinning and\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Yeah Theres something fun about it though like feeling that rear weight kicking around you know And again\n",
      "No its great\n",
      " its not efficient\n",
      "It had a good feel to it\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Yeah I agree\n",
      "But thats what I was talking about earlier about that little car that I have the 93 911 Its not fast Its not the besthandling car but its more satisfying than any other car I have because its so mechanical Its like everything aboutit like crack holes and bumps and it gives you all this feedback And I take it to the comic store because when Iget there I feel like my brain is just popping and its on fire Its like a strategy for me now that I really stop drivingother cars there I drive that car there just for the brain juice just for the\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "The interaction\n",
      "I mean you should try Model S P100D\n",
      "Ill try it\n",
      "It will blow your mind\n",
      "Okay\n",
      " and your skull\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Tell me what to order Ill order it\n",
      "Model S P100D\n",
      "Okay Jamie write it down\n",
      "Thats the car that I drive\n",
      "Okay Okay Ill get the car you drive Okay\n",
      "It will blow your mind\n",
      "How far can I drive\n",
      " out of your skull\n",
      "I believe you\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "How far can I drive How far can I drive\n",
      "About 300 miles\n",
      "Thats good For LA regular days thats good\n",
      "You will never notice the battery\n",
      "Never\n",
      "Never\n",
      "How hard is it to get like one of them crazy plugs installed in your house That difficult\n",
      "No its super easy Its like yeah\n",
      "Do you\n",
      "Its like a dryer plug Its like a dryer outlet\n",
      "Didnt you come up with some crazy tiles for your roof that are solar paneled\n",
      "Yeah yeah I have it on my roof right now actually Im just trying it out The thing is it takes a while to test roofstuff because roofs have to last a long time\n",
      "Right\n",
      "So like you want your roof to last like 30 years\n",
      "Could you put it over a regular roof\n",
      "No So theres two versions Its like the solar panels you put on a roof So like it depends on whether your roofsnew or old So if your roofs new you dont want to replace the roof You want to put like solar panels on the roof\n",
      "Right\n",
      "So thats like retrofit you know And they were trying to make the retrofit panels look real nice But then the newproduct were coming out with it is if you have a roof thats either youre building a house or youre going to replaceyour roof anyway then you make the tiles have solar cells embedded in the tiles\n",
      "And then its quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the glass tile So you have toreally work with the glass and the various coatings and the layers so that you dont see the solar cells behind theglass Otherwise it doesnt look right\n",
      "Right\n",
      "So its really tricky\n",
      "There it is Jaime put it up there\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Man that looks good Is there a\n",
      "See like if you look closely you can see If you zoom in like you can see the cell But if you zoom out you dontsee the cell\n",
      "Right but it looks though\n",
      "See\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Like thats hard\n",
      "Thats invisible solar cells\n",
      "Its really hard because you have to get the sunlight go through\n",
      "Right\n",
      "But when it gets reflected back out it doesnt  it hides the fact that theres a cell there\n",
      "Now are those available to the consumer right now\n",
      "Well we have  I think thats\n",
      "Those on that roof right there\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Thats amazing Oh that looks good\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Ooh I like that\n",
      "That one is hard\n",
      "Oh So you get that kind of fake Spanish looking thing I like that\n",
      "Thats French slate\n",
      "Thats why people in Connecticut are smoking pipes Look at that one\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Thats badass dude So now\n",
      "This will actually work\n",
      "I believe you So the solar panels that are on that house that we just looked at is that sufficient to power theentire home\n",
      "It depends on your energy on how efficient\n",
      "Expenditure\n",
      "Yeah yeah\n",
      "Right\n",
      "So generally yes I would say its probably for most Its going to vary but anywhere from more than you need tomaybe half Like call it half to 15 of the energy that you need depending on how much roof you have relative toliving space\n",
      "And how ridiculous you are with your TV\n",
      "TVs no problem Air conditioning\n",
      "Air conditioning\n",
      "Air conditioning is the problem If you have an efficient air conditioner and you dont  and depending on how like are you air conditioning rooms when they dont need to be air conditioned which is very common\n",
      "Right\n",
      " because its a pain in the neck you know Its like programming a VCR Its like\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Now its just blinking 1200 So people are just like The hell with that Im just going to make it this temperatureall day long\n",
      "Right You know how a smart home where if youre in the room then it stays cool right\n",
      "Yeah it should predict when youre going to be home and then cool the rooms that youre likely to use with a littlebit of intelligence Were not talking about like genius home here Were talking like elementary basic stuff\n",
      "Right\n",
      "You know like if you could hook that into the car like manage you coming home Like theres no point cooling thehome\n",
      "Right\n",
      " keeping the home really cool when youre not there\n",
      "Right\n",
      "But it can tell that youre coming home its just going to cool it to the right temperature right when you get there\n",
      "Do you have an app that works with your solar panels or anything like that\n",
      "Yeah Yeah we do\n",
      "And\n",
      "But we need to hook it into the air conditioning to really make the air conditioning work\n",
      "Have you thought about creating an air conditioning system I know you have Trick question\n",
      "Cannot answer questions about the future of potential products\n",
      "Okay Lets just let it go Well move on to the next thing\n",
      "That would be an interesting idea\n",
      "Yeah I would say radiant heating and all that good ideas Now when you think about the efficiency of thesehomes and you think about implementing solar power and battery power is there anything else that people aremissing Is there any other  Like I just saw a smartwatch that is powered by the heat of the human body andsome new technology\n",
      "Its able to fully power that way\n",
      "I dont know\n",
      "Okay\n",
      " if its fully or if its  Like this watch right here this is a Casio\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Its called a Pro Trek And its like an outdoors watch and its solarpowered\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "And so it has the ability to operate for a certain amount of time on solar\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "So if you have it exposed it could function for a certain amount of time on solar\n",
      "Yeah Well you know like theres selfweighting watches where\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      " you know its just got a weight in the watch And as you move your wrist the way it moves from one side to theother and it winds the watch up Thats a pretty cool thing\n",
      "Yeah yeah\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Well its amazing that like Rolexes that its all done mechanically\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Theres no batteries in there There is no nothing\n",
      "Yeah You could do the same thing You create a little charger thats based on wrist movement It really depends onhow much energy your watch uses\n",
      "You know whats fucked up about that though We accept a certain amount of like fuckery with those watches LikeI brought my watch I have a Rolex that my friend Lorenzo gave me and I brought it to the watch store and I saidThis things always fast I said Its always like after a couple of months its like five minutes fast And they goYup They go Yeah\n",
      "Really\n",
      "Its just what it does\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "I go Hold on I go So youre telling me that it just is always going to be fast Theyre like Yeah Its just likeevery few months you get like reset it\n",
      "It seems like they should recalibrate that thing\n",
      "They cant They tried They say every few months whether its four months or five months or six months itsgoing to be a couple of minutes fast\n",
      "Okay It seems like they should really recalibrate that because\n",
      "You should figure that shit out\n",
      " if its always fast you can just\n",
      "Right\n",
      " you know delete those minutes\n",
      "You need to fucking kick down the door at Rolex and go You bitches are lazy\n",
      "Its kind of amazing that you can keep time mechanically on a wristwatch with these tiny little gears\n",
      "Its amazing\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I mean the whole luxury watch market is fascinating Im not that involved in terms  Like I dont buy them Ivebought them as gifts I dont buy them for myself But when I look at them online theres a million dollar watchesout there now that are like they have like a little rotating moons and stars\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "And they live  Like look at this thing how much is that when Jaime\n",
      "I dont know I just picked one\n",
      "These are fucking preposterous guess I like gears I love them I love them\n",
      "Yeah I think that is beautiful\n",
      "But theres some of these people that are just taking it right in the ass Theyre buying these watches for like750000  Like Yeah thats a Timex son Nobody knows Its not any better than some Casio that you could justbuy on  Like look at that though\n",
      "Well heres the thing If youre a person that doesnt just want to know the time you want craftsmanship you wantsome artisans touch you want innovation in terms of like a person figuring out how gears and cogs all line upperfectly to every time it turns over its basically a second I mean thats just  Theres this art to that\n",
      "Yeah I agree\n",
      "Yeah its not just telling time Yeah I like this watch a lot but if it got hit by a rock I wouldnt be sad\n",

      "Wow\n",
      "It was a weird dream man It was so strange And Ive had it more than once\n",
      "That would result in a very rapid technology innovation Thats for sure\n",

      " pretty fucking amazing ideas\n",
      "Yes\n",

      "I should I never thought people would like it that much\n",
      "Well most people would but they cant be So thats like some superhero type shit You know we wouldnt want tobe Spiderman Id rather just sleep tight in Gotham City and hope hes out there doing his job\n",
      "Its very hard to turn it off\n",
      "Yeah Whats the hardest part\n",
      "It might sound great if its turned on but what if it doesnt turn off\n",
      "Now I showed you the isolation tank and youve never experienced that before\n",
      "No\n",
      "I think that could help you turn it off a little bit just for the night\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Yeah Just give you a little bit of sleep a little bit of perspective Its magnesium that you get from the water as wellthat makes you sleep easier because the water has Epsom salts in it But may be some sort of strategy forsacrificing your  or not sacrificing but enhancing your biological recovery time by figuring out a way whether itsthrough meditation or some other ways to shut off that thing at night Like you must have like a constant stream ofideas thats running through your head all the time Youre getting text messages from chicks\n",
      "No Im getting text messages from a friend saying What the hell are you doing smoking weed\n",
      "Is that bad for you Its legal\n",

      "Almost never I mean its\n",
      "How does it feel\n",
      "I dont actually notice any effect\n",
      "Well there you go There was a time where I think it was Ramadan for someone gave some Buddhist monk a bunchof acid\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "And he ate it and it had no effect on him\n",
      "I doubt that\n",
      "I would say that too but Ive never meditated to the level that some of these people have where theyre constantlymeditating all day They dont have any material possessions And all of their energy is spent trying to achieve acertain mindset I would like to cynically deny that Id like to cynically say Hey just fuck and think the same way Ido Theyre just hanging out with flip flops on and make weird noises but maybe no\n",
      "You know I know a lot of people like weed and thats fine but I dont find that it is very good for productivity\n",
      "For you\n",
      "Not for me\n",
      "Yeah I mean I would imagine that for someone like you its not For someone like you it would be more like a cupof coffee right You want to have a latte\n",
      "Yeah Its more like the opposite of a cup of coffee\n",
      "What is that\n",
      "Its like a cup of coffee in reverse\n",
      "Weed is\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "No Im saying you would like more More like will be beneficial to you It would be like coffee\n",
      "I like to get things done I like to be useful That is one of the hardest things to do is to be useful\n",
      "When you say you like to get things done\n",
      "Yes\n",
      " like in terms of like what\n",
      "I should get things done\n",
      " gives you satisfaction When you complete a project when something that you invent comes to fruition and yousee people enjoying it that feeling\n",
      "Yes doing something useful for other people that I like doing\n",
      "Thats interesting for other people\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "So that do you think that that is maybe the way you recognize that you have this unusual position in the culturewhere you can uniquely influence certain things because of this I mean you essentially have a gift right\n",
      "Sure\n",
      "I mean you would think it was a curse but Im sure its been fueled by many many years of discipline andlearning But you essentially have a gift and that you have this radical sort of creativity engine when it comes toinnovation and technology Its like youre just youre going at very high RPMs\n",
      "All the time That doesnt stop\n",
      "What is that like\n",
      "I dont know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank\n",
      "Lets try it\n",
      "It sounds a little concerning\n",
      "But why\n",
      "Its like running the engine with no resistance That is\n",
      "Is that what it is though Maybe its not\n",
      "Maybe its fine I dont know\n",
      "How much\n",
      "Ill try it Ill try it\n",
      "Have you ever\n",
      "Its fine\n",
      " experimented with meditation or anything\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "What do you do or what have you done rather\n",
      "I mean just sort of sit there and be quiet and then repeat some mantra which acts as a focal point It does stillthe mind It does still the mind but I dont find myself drawn to it frequently\n",
      "Do you think that perhaps productivity is maybe more attractive to you than enlightenment or even the concept ofwhatever enlightenment means Like what are you trying to achieve when youre meditating all the time Withyou it seems like almost like theres a franticness to your creativity that comes out of this burning furnace And inorder for you to like calm that thing down you might have to throw too much water on it\n",
      "Its like a neverending explosion\n",
      "Like what is it like Try to explain it to a dumb person like me Whats going on\n",
      "Neverending explosion\n",
      "Its just constant ideas just bouncing around\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Damn\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "So when everybody leaves its just Elon sitting at home brushing his teeth just bunch ideas bouncing around yourhead\n",
      "Yeah all the time\n",
      "When did you realize that thats not the case with most people\n",
      "I think when I was I dont know five or six or something I thought I was insane\n",
      "Why did you think you were insane\n",
      "Because it is clear that other people do not Their mind wasnt exploding with ideas all the time\n",
      "So they werent expressing it They werent talking about it all day And you realized by the time you were five orsix like Oh theyre probably not even getting this thing that Im getting\n",
      "No It was just strange It was like Hmm kind of strange That was my conclusion kind of strange\n",
      "But did you feel diminished by it in any way Like knowing that this is a weird thing that you really probablycouldnt commiserate with other people they wouldnt understand you\n",
      "I hope they wouldnt find out because they might like put me away or something\n",
      "You thought that\n",
      "For a second yes\n",
      "When you were little\n",
      "Yeah They put people away What if they put me away\n",
      "Like when you were little you thought this\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Wow Well you thought This is so radically different than the people that are around me if they find out I got thisstream coming in\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Whoa\n",
      "But you know I was only like five or six probably\n",
      "Do you think this is like  I mean theres outliers biologically You mean theres people that are 7 foot 9 therespeople that have giant hands theres people that have eyes that are 2015 vision Theres always the outliers Doyou feel like you like caught this like you have got some  youre like on some weird innovation creativity sort ofwave thats very unusual Like you tapped into  I mean just think of the various things you may haveaccomplished in a very short amount of time and youre constantly doing this Thats a weird  Youre a weirdperson right\n",
      "Right I agree\n",
      "Yeah Like what if theres a million Elon Musks\n",
      "Well that would be very very weird\n",
      "Whoa\n",
      "Yeah it would be pretty weird I agree\n",
      "Real weird\n",
      "Definitely\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "What if there were a million Joe Rogans\n",
      "There probably is Theres probably two million I mean I think thats the case with a lot of folks\n",
      "Yeah I mean but like you know my goal is like try to do useful things try to maximize the probability for thefutures good make the future exciting something you look forward to you know You know with Tesla I want totry to make things that people love Like how do you think you could buy that you really love that really give youjoy So rare so rare I wish there were more things Thats what we try to do Just make things that somebodyloves\n",
      "When you\n",
      "Thats so difficult\n",
      "When you think about things that someone loves like do you specifically think about like what things wouldimprove peoples experience like what would change the way people interface with life that would make themmore relaxed or more happy You really think like when youre thinking about things like that is that like one ofyour considerations Like what could I do that would help people\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      " that maybe they wouldnt be able to figure out\n",
      "Yeah Like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better Like you know like so I think afuture where we are a spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars This is very exciting This makes melook forward to a future This makes me want that future You know the things there need to be things that makeyou look forward to waking up in the morning\n",
      "You wake up in the morning you look forward to the day you look forward to the future And a future where we area spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars I think thats very exciting That is a thing we wantwhereas if we knew we would not be a spacefaring civilization but forever confined to Earth this would not be agood future That would be very sad I think\n",
      "It would be so sad in terms\n",
      "Like I dont want a sad future\n",
      " just the finite lifespan of the Earth itself\n",
      "Yes\n",
      " and the solar system itself But even though its possibly  You know I mean how long do they feel like the sunand the solar system is going to exist How many hundreds of millions of years\n",
      "Well its probably if youre saying when does the sun boil the oceans\n",
      "Right\n",
      "About 500 million years\n",
      "So is it sad that we never leave because in 500 million years that happens Is that what youre saying\n",
      "No I just think like if there are two futures and one future us were out there among the stars and the things weread about and see in science fiction movies the good ones are true and we have these starships and were goingsee what other planets are like and were a multiplanet species and the scope and scale of consciousness isexpanded across many civilizations and many planets and many star systems this is a great future This is awonderful thing to me And thats what we should strive for\n",
      "But thats biological travel Thats cells traveling physically to another location\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Do you think thats definitely where were going\n",
      "No\n",
      "Yeah I dont think so either I used to think so And now Im thinking more likely less than ever Like almost everyday less likely\n",
      "We can definitely go to the moon and Mars\n",
      "Yeah Do you think we will colonize\n",
      "I think we will go to the asteroid belt And we can go to the moons of Jupiter Saturn even get to Pluto\n",
      "Thatd be the craziest place ever if we colonize Mars and reform it and turn it into like a big Jamaica Just oceansand\n",
      "I think we should I think that would be great\n",
      "I mean imagine that there is\n",
      "That would be great Amazing\n",
      "Its possible right\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "We can turn the whole thing into Cancún\n",
      "Well\n",

      "Yeah you can warm it up You could add air You get some water there I mean over time hundreds of millions ofyears or whatever it takes\n",
      "Well be a multiplanet species\n",
      "Yeah that would be amazing\n",
      "Were a multiplanet species\n",
      "If we could\n",

      "I mean you know strangely I think a lot of people dont like humanity and see it as a blight but I do not\n",
      "Well I think one of those  I think part of that is just theyve been  you know theyve been struggling Whenpeople struggle they associate their struggle with other people They never internalize their problems They look toother people as holding them back and people suck and fuck people and its just  You know its a never endingcycle But not always Again most people are really good Most people the vast majority\n",
      "This may sound corny\n",
      "It does sound corny\n",
      "But love is the answer\n",
      "It is you answer\n",
      "Yup\n",
      "Yeah it is It sounds corny because were all scared You know were all scared of trying to love people beingrejected or someone taking advantage of you because youre trying to be loving\n",
      "Sure\n",
      "What if we all could just relax and love each other\n",
      "It wouldnt hurt to have more love in the world\n",
      "It definitely wouldnt hurt\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "It would be great\n",
      "Yeah we should do that\n",
      "Yeah I agree man\n",
      "Like really\n",
      "How are you going to fix that Do you have a love machine youre working on\n",
      "No but probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media\n",
      "Now deleting social media from your applications from your phones will that give you a 10 boost to happinessWhat do you think the percentage is\n",
      "I think probably something like that yeah\n",
      "Yeah a good 10\n",
      "Yeah I mean the only thing Ive kept is Twitter because I kind of like meet some means of getting a message outyou know\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Well thats about it So far so good\n",
      "Well whats interesting with you you actually occasionally engage with people on Twitter\n",
      "Yeah thats\n",
      "What percentage of that is a good idea\n",
      "Good question\n",
      "Probably 10 right Its hard\n",
      "Its mostly  I think its on balance more good than bad but theres definitely some bad So\n",
      "Do you ever\n",
      "Hopefully the good outweighs the bad\n",
      "Do you ever think about how odd it is the weird feeling that you get when someone says something shitty to youon Twitter and you read it That weird feeling This weird little negative jolt Its like a subjective negative jolt ofenergy that you dont really need to absorb but you do anyway Like I want to fuck this guy Fuck him\n",
      "I mean theres a lot of negativity on Twitter\n",
      "It is but its a weird in its form Like the way if you ingest it as if youre like  you try to be like a little scientist asyoure ingesting it youre like How weird is this And Im even getting upset at some strange person sayingsomething mean to me Its not even accurate\n",
      "I mean the vast number of negative comments for the vast majority I just ignore them the vast majority\n",

      "Yeah Well its even like\n",
      "Anything is forever\n",
      "And the thing is they dont want you to be able to delete it because the problem is if you dont delete it and youdont believe it anymore its really hard to say Hey that thing above I dont really believe that anymore Ichanged the way I view things\n",
      "Yes\n",
